A word of caution: dementors are vicious creatures. They will not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in there way. Therefore I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. It's not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, when one only remembers to turn on the light. by Albus Dumbledore
